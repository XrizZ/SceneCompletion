		This website presents the results and implementation details of
		a method for completing images using millions of photographs
		as presented in James Hays' and Alexei Efros' SIGGRAPH 2007
		<a href="http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/scene-completion/">paper</a>
		"Scene Completion Using Millions of Photographs". This project
		was part of the course Processing Digital Camera Images (winter term 2011/12) at
		<a href="http://www.cg.tu-berlin.de/">Technical University Berlin</a>. The implementation
		was done by Christian Thurow and Christopher Leiste over the course of one semester.

	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
		The main goal is to replace image information in a given query image in the area defined by a mask. Be it for the sake of missing
		image information or creating new versions of the input, the masked area is to be covered by another "appropriate"
		image. Figure 2 shows the proposed algorithm
		from a high level view. In order to find suitable candidates for insertion, we look up similar images in a large
		pre-processed image database, but use only descriptors of the images to compare them, rather than the pixel information
		themselves. Due to the massive amount of data being processed, pre-calculation of the almost 1.5M images is inevitable.

		Once a good match for the input image has been found, the paper suggests that the best fit is being calculated. This is done by 
		altering the scale, rotation and translation of the similar image and comparing it with the input image at the mask's position.
		After that the image is aligned properly we can then use a graph cut algorithm to improve 
		the mask in a way that it falls into areas for which the gradients of the two images to be combined are as similar as possible. 
		This will later result in a smooth transition when blending the images. Once the improved mask is available, the input image 
		is merged with the candidate using Poisson blending.
